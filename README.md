# 2d-Range-Tree-Implementation

# Thisreportfocusesontheexperimentalstudyofthedatastructure–RangeTree,whereweimplement tworangetreevariances: RangeTree−Org andRangeTree−FC,anddesignthreeexperimentsto show the performance of the data structure on construction and query efﬁciency. RangeTree−Org isconstitutedbyabaseWB−BST witheachinternalnodeassociatedwithasecondaryWB−BST on the y-coordinates of all the points in the sub-tree. RangeTree−FC replaces all the secondary trees in RangeTree−Org with sorted arrays and apply factional cascading techniques to query operation. For Range Tree-Org, we anticipate the consumption of the naïve construction is bounded by O(nlog2 n) and a more efﬁcient construction way consumes O(nlogn) time, and the query time is bounded by O(k + log2 n) where k is the number of points reported. For RangeTree−FC, we expect a construction consumption of O(nlogn) and a query time bound of O(k + logn).
